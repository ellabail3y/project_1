            <p>His work echos principles of abstraction and expressionism 
                and typically features pop culture imagery. I like that he  
                uses bold, electric colors and whimsical imagery, but his 
                work still remains rooted in real-world themes like consumerism  
                and the impacts of media culture</p>

            <p>He is a fashion photography and director of a fashion  
                magazine from the 70s-80s. His magazine was primarily
                image based and composed of his bold, sometimes 
                provacative photography. I recieved one of his magazines 
                as a gift and it inspired me to consider going into
                publication design</p>

            <p>She was a pioneering female art director for Harper's Bazaar 
            magazine. Her work is energetic and experimented a lot with 
            color and mix media, which is something I like to do with my 
            Her spreads are each unique, but somehow still remain 
            cohesive and harmonious throughout the magazines
